---++ Description

This plugin implements a way to display the difference between revisions of the same topic or 
between two distinct topics. This adds YADT (yet another diff tool) to those previously available, 
i.e. Foswiki's core =rdiff= as well as the <nop>CompareRevisionsAddOn's =compare= tools. In contrast
to previous work, <nop>%TOPIC% tries to display differences in a way users _really_ can see what the difference
actually is. It takes particularly care of any kind of meta data stored in a topic and diff these individually.
<nop>%TOPIC% implements a =%DIFF= macro so that you can use it in wiki applications easily. 

It integrates well with [[Foswiki:Extensions/AngularSkin][AngularSkin]]/[[Foswiki:Extensions/AngularPlugin][AngularPlugin]]
so that browsing among differences using the "tape-recorder" navigation feels most natural while going forward and backwards
between revisions.

---++ Examples

You type:

<verbatim class="tml">
%DIFF{
   oldtopic="%SYSTEMWEB%.UserForm" 
   newtopic="%USERSWEB%.UserForm"
}%
</verbatim>

You get:

<a href="%ATTACHURLPATH%/DiffScreenshot.png"><img src='%ATTACHURLPATH%/DiffScreenshot.png' width='400' alt='diff screenshot' /></a>

---++ Syntax

The =%DIFF= macro is mostly driven by defaults in the =diff.tmpl= template. Each parameter has got a named definition there being used
as a fallback in case the parameter wasn't specified as part of the =%DIFF= macro.

| *Parameter* | *Description* | *Default* |
| =oldtopic= | name of the topic on the left handside | current topic |
| =newtopic= | name of the topic on the right handside | =oldtopic= |
| =oldrev= | revision of =oldtopic= to diff | latest revision of =oldtopic= |
| =newrev=, =rev= | revision of the =newtopic= to diff | latest revision of =newtopic= |
| =offset= | alternative way to specify the number of revisions to diff: either use =oldrev= and =newrev=, or use =rev= and specify an =offset= into the revision history to diff | 1 |
| =context= | number of lines around a difference to display in addition to the difference itself | 2 |
| =beforetext= | text to be displayed before any output| =diff::beforetext= |
| =aftertext= | text to be appended to the output | =diff::aftertext= | 
| =header= | header of the diff table while iterating over all differences of a specific type | =diff::header= |
| =footer= | footer of a diff table | =diff::footer= | 
| =format= | row of a diff table | =diff::format= | 
| =meta_format= | format to be used to display meta data | =diff::meta_format= | 
| =separator= | separator between rows of a diff table | =diff::separator= | 
| =no_differences= | message to be displayed when no differences have been found | =diff::no_differences= |

The format strings can take a number of variables refering to the properties of the objects being processed:

   * =$oldtopic=: topic name (without the web name) of =oldtopic= 
   * =$oldweb=: web name of =oldtopic=
   * =$oldrev=: revision number of =oldtopic=
   * =$maxoldrev=: maximum numbers of revision in =oldtopic=
   * =$oldauthor=: author of the revision of =oldtopic= being processed
   * =$olddate=: date when =$oldauthor= edited revision =oldrev= of =oldtopic=

   * =$newtopic=: topic name (without the web name) of =newtopic= 
   * =$newweb=: web name of =newtopic=
   * =$newrev=: revision number of =newtopic=
   * =$maxnewrev=: maximum numbers of revision in =newtopic=
   * =$newauthor=: author of the revision of =newtopic= being processed
   * =$newdate=: date when =$newauthor= edited revision =newrev= of =newtopic=

   * =$offset=: offset between =$oldrev= and =$newrev=
   * =$maxrev=: alias for =$maxnewrev=
   * =$prevrev=: previous revision id
   * =$nextrev=: next revision id

   * =$old=: displays the difference of the current row being formatted in the column left column
   * =$new=: displays the difference of the current row being formatted in the column right column
   * =$action=: the kind of difference between =$old= and =$new=, can be "changed", "removed", "append" or "unchanged"
   * =$index=: row being diff'ed currently
   * =$name=: formfield filed name when diff'ing a !DataForm or any other custom meta data with a "name" attribute
   * =$type=: type of data being proccessed, can be "TEXT","TOPICINFO" or "TOPICPARENT", "FORM", "FIELD", "FILEATTACHMENT", "PREFERENCES" or the registered identifier of custom meta data

---++ Configuration

<nop>%TOPIC% comes with two scripts that may be used in your web-server environment - =diff= and =diffauth= - that can be used similar to =rdiff= and =rdiffauth=. No additional provisions
are required when using [[Foswiki:Extensions/FastCGIEngineContrib][FastCGIEngineContrib]] or any other persistent-perl environment where Foswiki's ={SwitchBoard}= mechanism is used to
schedule the =diff= action to this plugin.

To integrate <nop>%TOPIC% into the installed skin you may replace any call to =rdiff= with =diff=, or enable the ={PatchDiffScript}= to automatically replace any use of the =rdiff= or =compare=
scripts with a call to =diff=.
